Diary of a war in Israel

DIARY ENTRY — OCTOBER 6, 2023

Amal – Rafah, Gaza Strip

Scene opens on a candle flickering inside a cracked mason jar. The room is dim, bare except for a torn UNICEF notebook, a stub of a pencil, and a girl hunched over her words like they’re the only shelter left in the world.

Friday, October 6th, 2023

It’s been 417 days since your first letter, Yael.

Sometimes I forget that you weren’t always part of my world. That there was a time when I only knew “Israel” as a warning on the radio, a word in my brother’s clenched fists, a flag seen on distant drones. And then — you.

I still remember how it happened. It feels like another life.

Our teacher, Miss Salma, had this ancient computer in the corner of the classroom, with a screen that flickered like a dying eye. It barely worked, but she treated it like treasure.

One day, during a dust storm when no one could go outside, she showed us an old program — “Letters Across Borders.” It was from some United Nations group, abandoned after one year, but the database was still online. Most schools had stopped using it. We were curious, so she let each of us send one message. One message.

“Be honest,” she said. “But kind.”

I wrote mine half in sarcasm, half in boredom.

“Hello, I’m Amal. I live in Gaza. It’s not as scary as you think, unless you’re afraid of pigeons and fried eggplants.”

I didn’t expect a reply.

Two weeks later, a message came back.

“Hi Amal, I’m Yael. I live in a kibbutz near the border. I’m more afraid of bees than bombs. We have sunflowers here. And a dog named Achi.”

I read it twice. Then again.

The class didn’t believe it was real. But I knew. The way you wrote about the wind through the fields — no one makes that up.

And so it began.

We sent real letters at first, passed through the strange gap between our worlds: UN field officers, peace monitors, aid convoys. Every month or so, a message would arrive, wrapped in tape and hope.

When the program was shut down, you found a way to message me anyway — through your cousin in Tel Aviv who works with that foreign human rights group.

I had to hide the letters from Baba. He still doesn’t know.

But Yusuf found one once. He didn’t yell. He just looked at me like I’d let something inside the house that didn’t belong. He hasn’t mentioned it since.

You are my secret, Yael.

But not the kind I’m ashamed of.

You asked me once what it feels like to live here.

Gaza feels like being inside someone else’s clenched hand. Like the sky is being held just inches too low, and if you stand up too straight, you’ll hit your head on something invisible.

Rafah smells like old oil, heat, and grief that no longer cries. Our buildings lean like tired men. The power lines swing like nooses in the wind. Even our shadows seem thinner these days.

At night, the hum of the Zanana — the Israeli drone — doesn’t stop. It’s like an electric ghost that never sleeps. I wonder if you can hear it too, from the other side. Or if you ever saw its camera staring down.

Do you remember the video I once described — the one where the boy ran through smoke to find his sister, and when he did, she was gone? That was our neighbor. I never told you that. I didn’t want you to stop writing.

And yet… despite all of it — here we are.

I’m writing to you.

I picture your fingers turning this page, somewhere beyond the fences, in a house that still has windows.

Today, I sat on the broken tile steps and thought of you. It was noon, the kind of noon that burns your breath. Mama had taken the last bucket of water to the rooftop tank. I watched her from below, her dress flapping like a flag too tired to wave.

Yusuf returned late last night. He didn’t speak much. His eyes darted like there was something behind me. He smells different now. Not like a person, but like something between smoke and thunder.

“I fight for us,” he says.

But who fights for me?

Hadiya is still gone — my cat. My sister says she probably climbed into one of the aid trucks. I like that version better than the others I imagine.

There’s no electricity again. The fridge is dead, like everything else that breathes here. But this notebook is alive. Because of you.

Yael, wherever you are — thank you for existing.

If you stop writing, I’ll understand. But I hope you don’t.

Because when I write to you, I feel almost… real.

Like I haven’t disappeared yet.

Yours,
Amal



DIARY ENTRY — OCTOBER 6, 2023

Yael – Kibbutz Be’eri, Israel

Scene opens in golden light. Wind brushes through sunflower fields. A girl sits on her bed beneath a poster of Billie Eilish. A small dog is curled at her feet. There’s a backpack on the floor, half-packed for school. She writes in a soft leather journal, the kind her grandmother gave her last Hanukkah.

Friday, October 6th, 2023

Amal,

You asked me once what it’s like to live here.

I didn’t answer properly, I think. I said something stupid like “quiet,” or “safe.” Maybe I just didn’t want to admit how much I don’t understand.

Kibbutz Be’eri is surrounded by sunflowers. They’re dry now — this close to the end of the season — but they still stand tall, even when the wind comes in off the fence line. That wind always tastes like sand and eucalyptus.

Today was warm. The kind of warm that makes your shirt stick to your back and the dogs sleep in the shade all day.

Achi didn’t move from the porch once. He’s getting old.

I lay in the grass for a while, just watching the clouds. One looked like a girl’s hand reaching up from water. Another looked like nothing at all, but I stared at it anyway.

My mom says I should stop “daydreaming about things I can’t fix.” But that’s all I do lately.

My oldest brother, Eitan, called from his base up north. He’s in the IDF. Every time he calls, Ima puts it on speaker, like it’s a holy broadcast.

“How’s the kibbutz?” he asked.

“Quiet,” I said.

He said, “That’s what worries me.”

Abba nodded, arms folded. He always does that when Eitan talks about the army. He’s proud. Too proud. I think he wants to be Eitan when he speaks — strong, certain, unshakable.

But I know things he doesn’t. I know you.

I haven’t told him. Or Eitan. Or anyone except Grandma.

She’s the one who gave me the journal and said, “Write the truth, not what they tell you to write.”

You know, Amal, the first time I read your letter, I thought it was fake. Like a school assignment someone made up to trick us into being nice. But then I saw how you signed it — with that little heart and the word “shukran.”

I don’t know why, but it felt real.

When I replied, I didn’t tell you that my cousin worked with a human rights group in Tel Aviv. I just said I wanted to know who you were. I wanted to know if girls on the other side of the fence liked falafel or ice cream or Taylor Swift.

And now here we are.

I’m not supposed to write you.

If my father knew — or Eitan — they’d lose their minds. My mother would say nothing, but I think she’d cry in the laundry room like she does when the news gets too loud.

But I keep writing. Because you’re the only person who talks to me like I’m not a side.

Do you know how strange that is? To live in a place where everyone has already chosen who you are, before you even open your mouth?

Here, we have drills every other week. When the sirens go off, we have to run to the shelter near the community center. We laugh sometimes — nervous laughs — but we always check who’s missing.

We have a fence. A high one. It keeps things out, they say. But sometimes I think it also keeps us in.

The news is always on.

This morning, there was a segment about border activity. A soldier spoke into a camera about “preventive measures.” They used the word “deterrence” like it was a flavor of ice cream.

I turned it off.

I sat with Achi and looked across the fields. I couldn’t see Gaza, not really. Just the horizon, flat and dusty. But I imagined you there.

Maybe we were looking at the same sky.

I like to think that if I could scream loud enough, you’d hear me.

But instead I write.

Always,

Yael

 
DIARY ENTRY — OCTOBER 7, 2023

Yael – Kibbutz Be’eri, Southern Israel

Scene opens with sunlight cutting through a window — golden and calm — as the distant hum of a morning begins. The camera is still. A bird lands on the windowsill. Then a single explosion in the distance. Barking. Then screams. The screen flickers. Everything shifts.

Saturday, October 7th, 2023

I don’t know if this is a letter, or if I’m just trying to prove I still exist.

This morning started like any other.

I woke up to Achi licking my feet. He always does that when the light hits his bowl and he thinks it’s breakfast time. The sun was rising slow. You know that quiet light we get in Be’eri — when everything turns pale orange, like the whole kibbutz is holding its breath? That’s what it was like.

I sat up. I could hear Ima in the kitchen, humming. She always hums on Shabbat mornings. Eitan wasn’t home, of course. Abba was already dressed. He’s always dressed before sunrise.

I was brushing Achi’s ears when it started.

The first sound wasn’t a rocket. It was gunfire.

Not from far. Not from the border. From here.

We all froze. Then the siren came. But it wasn’t the usual warning — not the kind you hear during drills. It was the other one. The one we’ve never practiced.

There was shouting outside. Not Hebrew. Fast, guttural.

Abba grabbed me by the arm. “We go now.” His face — I’ve never seen it like that. Like something inside him snapped in two.

We ran.

Ima took the emergency bag. We ran barefoot to the shelter down the path, the one near the mango trees. Achi followed, barking.

And then…

Gunshots. From behind us. Then — a scream.

I turned. Achi had stopped.

I saw one of them — a man in black, with a green headband and a rifle that looked too big for a person.

Abba shoved me forward.

“Don’t look back!”

I heard Achi yelp.

That sound — I swear it split something inside me.

We made it to the shelter. The door wouldn’t lock. Abba held it shut with his body. Ima was praying in whispers I didn’t recognize. I just sat there, shivering. There was blood on my feet but I didn’t know whose.

They found us.

The door opened.

Three men. They pointed guns. Abba tried to speak. “We are civilians. She’s a child.”

They shouted. Pushed him to the floor. Tied Ima’s hands.

One of them looked at me and paused.

He couldn’t have been older than Eitan. Maybe younger.

“Come,” he said.

I didn’t move. I couldn’t.

Then they took them. My parents.

They didn’t even look back at me. I don’t think they were allowed to.

I don’t know how long I stayed in that shelter. Hours maybe. I only came out when the shooting stopped.

The path was red.

My neighbor’s front door was swinging on one hinge. There were shoes scattered in the dirt. A child’s sandal. Blood on a baby carriage.

I walked to my house. The windows were blown out. My bookshelf was collapsed. My posters torn. The walls were scorched.

Achi was lying near the steps.

His fur was wet.

I sat beside him and held his body until the soldiers came.

They told me to get in a truck. I asked where my parents were.

“We’re looking,” they said.

They asked me if I had any family.

“Eitan,” I whispered.

They nodded.

I haven’t stopped shaking since.

I keep hearing the barking.

I keep seeing the boy with the gun.

Amal —

This isn’t a war.

This is something else.

I don’t even know if this letter will reach you. But if it does, I want you to know… I’m still here.

And I will keep writing, as long as I have pages left.

Yael


DIARY ENTRY — OCTOBER 7, 2023

Amal – Rafah, Gaza Strip

Scene opens in amber dusk. A girl leans against the frame of a window with no glass, watching the horizon pulse red. The light flickers against her face. The air trembles with the distant hum of jets. Somewhere, a radio whispers.

It began with silence.

That’s how we knew something was wrong. Gaza is never truly silent. There’s always noise — the scraping of carts on concrete, the whining buzz of a generator, shouting in the alleys, the echo of water being carried from rooftop tanks.

But today… the streets held their breath.

Yusuf was already pacing by 7 a.m. I could hear his boots across the tiles. Mama asked him to sit, just once, to eat breakfast like a human being. He shook his head.

“Something’s moving,” he said. “There’s fire in the air.”

I didn’t understand. I still don’t.

The radio came alive just after eight. Voices blurred together. Then words sharpened:

“Operation across the border… militants inside Israeli territory… dozens dead… hostages taken…”

Mama dropped the pot she was holding. The lid clattered like gunshots on the floor.

I looked at Yusuf. His eyes didn’t move.

“It’s started,” he said.

The news was shaky, unreliable. One second it was about a music festival. The next — soldiers captured. Then — settlements burning.

And then we lost the signal.

Yusuf left the house without saying goodbye. Just grabbed his vest and rifle and slammed the door so hard that dust fell from the ceiling.

I sat with Lina — my little sister. She kept asking if school was still open on Sunday.

I wanted to laugh. Or cry. I did neither.

At noon, the first planes came.

We didn’t see them — not right away. But we heard them.

A sound like the air being ripped in half. Like the sky being crushed under glass.

Then the explosion.

I saw it from the window. A column of fire rising over the rooftops in Khan Younis. A building disappearing into smoke. Then another.

The sound came late. It always does.

Mama screamed. Lina began to cry.

Everything happened too fast after that.

We grabbed what we could — bread, water, my school bag. We ran to the neighbor’s basement. The stairwell was already crowded. The air smelled like sweat and fear and something chemical I couldn’t name.

There were so many of us down there. Twenty-three. Maybe more. One baby kept wailing until its mother wrapped him in a scarf.

Someone had a small radio. We listened in fragments. Entire buildings gone. Families buried. Border closed.

“We are under attack,” said the voice.

No one needed to tell us. We could feel it in our teeth.

I keep thinking about you, Yael.

Are you alive? Are you safe?

I imagine your kibbutz full of flowers. I imagine people running through the fields, their faces covered in dirt and blood. I imagine you curled under a table, or alone in a shelter, wondering what we’ve done.

I want to tell you — I didn’t know.

I didn’t want this.

But there’s no way to send letters now.

No mail trucks. No internet. Only fire.

Mama says the strikes will continue all night. She says if we have to leave, we go south. But where is there to go, Yael? The sea? The wall?

This house was never a castle. But it was ours.

Now I look at the ceiling and wonder if it will hold.

If you’re reading this someday — not now, but later, when this is all over — I want you to know something.

Even now, in this place, on this day,

I do not hate you.

I only hate what is happening to both of us.

Amal
